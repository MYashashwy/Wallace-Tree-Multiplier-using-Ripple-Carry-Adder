# 128-bit Wallace Tree Multiplier using Ripple Carry Adder

## Overview
This project implements a 128-bit Wallace Tree Multiplier using a Ripple Carry Adder (RCA). Wallace Tree Multipliers are efficient in terms of delay, and RCA modules are used here to perform intermediate addition operations.

## Features
- 128-bit multiplier.
- Optimized for speed using the Wallace Tree approach.
- Simple and understandable RCA-based design.
